# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a BASIC interpreter written in Go using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. The interpreter will be built incrementally with tests written before implementation code, ensuring each component is thoroughly tested and meets its requirements. The interpreter will support core BASIC language constructs including variables, control flow, arithmetic operations, and basic I/O operations, with each feature developed through the red-green-refactor TDD cycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to load and execute BASIC programs from files, so that I can run existing BASIC code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid BASIC program file THEN the interpreter SHALL load and parse the program successfully
2. WHEN a user executes a loaded program THEN the interpreter SHALL execute each line in the correct sequence
3. IF a program file contains syntax errors THEN the interpreter SHALL report clear error messages with line numbers

#### TDD Requirements

1. WHEN writing tests for file loading THEN tests SHALL be written before implementing file I/O functionality
2. WHEN implementing program parsing THEN failing tests SHALL be written first to define expected parsing behavior
3. WHEN adding error handling THEN tests SHALL verify error messages and line number reporting before implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use variables and perform arithmetic operations, so that I can write programs that manipulate data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program assigns a value to a variable THEN the interpreter SHALL store the value and make it available for subsequent operations
2. WHEN a program performs arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^) THEN the interpreter SHALL calculate the correct result
3. WHEN a program uses both numeric and string variables THEN the interpreter SHALL handle type distinctions appropriately
4. IF a variable is used before being assigned THEN the interpreter SHALL initialize numeric variables to 0 and string variables to empty string

#### TDD Requirements

1. WHEN implementing variable storage THEN tests SHALL define expected behavior for variable assignment and retrieval before coding
2. WHEN adding arithmetic operations THEN tests SHALL verify operator precedence and edge cases before implementation
3. WHEN supporting type conversion THEN tests SHALL cover all conversion scenarios before writing conversion logic
4. WHEN handling uninitialized variables THEN tests SHALL verify default values before implementing initialization behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use control flow statements (GOTO, IF-THEN, FOR-NEXT), so that I can create programs with loops and conditional logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program executes a GOTO statement THEN the interpreter SHALL jump to the specified line number
2. WHEN a program executes an IF-THEN statement THEN the interpreter SHALL evaluate the condition and execute the THEN clause only if true
3. WHEN a program executes a FOR-NEXT loop THEN the interpreter SHALL iterate the specified number of times with correct variable incrementation
4. IF a GOTO references a non-existent line number THEN the interpreter SHALL report an error
5. IF a FOR loop is missing its corresponding NEXT THEN the interpreter SHALL report an error

#### TDD Requirements

1. WHEN implementing GOTO functionality THEN tests SHALL verify program counter changes before writing jump logic
2. WHEN adding conditional statements THEN tests SHALL cover all comparison operators and edge cases before implementation
3. WHEN creating loop structures THEN tests SHALL verify nested loops and boundary conditions before coding loop logic
4. WHEN handling control flow errors THEN tests SHALL define expected error messages before implementing error detection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform input and output operations (PRINT, INPUT), so that my programs can interact with users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program executes a PRINT statement THEN the interpreter SHALL output the specified values to stdout
2. WHEN a program executes an INPUT statement THEN the interpreter SHALL prompt the user and read their input into the specified variable
3. WHEN printing multiple values THEN the interpreter SHALL separate them appropriately (spaces or specified separators)
4. WHEN reading input for numeric variables THEN the interpreter SHALL validate and convert the input appropriately

#### TDD Requirements

1. WHEN implementing PRINT functionality THEN tests SHALL use mocked output to verify formatting before writing print logic
2. WHEN adding INPUT capabilities THEN tests SHALL use mocked input streams to test reading behavior before implementation
3. WHEN handling output formatting THEN tests SHALL verify separator behavior and value formatting before coding
4. WHEN validating input THEN tests SHALL cover invalid input scenarios and error handling before implementing validation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use built-in functions (ABS, INT, RND, etc.), so that I can perform common mathematical operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program calls ABS(x) THEN the interpreter SHALL return the absolute value of x
2. WHEN a program calls INT(x) THEN the interpreter SHALL return the integer part of x
3. WHEN a program calls RND THEN the interpreter SHALL return a random number between 0 and 1
4. WHEN a program calls LEN(string) THEN the interpreter SHALL return the length of the string
5. IF a function is called with invalid arguments THEN the interpreter SHALL report an appropriate error

#### TDD Requirements

1. WHEN implementing mathematical functions THEN tests SHALL verify function results with known inputs before writing function logic
2. WHEN adding string functions THEN tests SHALL cover edge cases like empty strings before implementation
3. WHEN creating random number generation THEN tests SHALL verify range and distribution properties before coding
4. WHEN handling function errors THEN tests SHALL define expected error messages for invalid arguments before implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling and debugging information, so that I can identify and fix issues in my BASIC programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a runtime error occurs THEN the interpreter SHALL display the error message with the line number where it occurred
2. WHEN a syntax error is detected THEN the interpreter SHALL report the error before execution begins
3. WHEN the interpreter encounters an infinite loop THEN it SHALL provide a way to interrupt execution
4. WHEN debugging mode is enabled THEN the interpreter SHALL show each line before execution

#### TDD Requirements

1. WHEN implementing error reporting THEN tests SHALL verify error message format and line number accuracy before coding
2. WHEN adding syntax validation THEN tests SHALL cover all syntax error scenarios before implementing validation
3. WHEN creating interrupt handling THEN tests SHALL verify timeout and signal handling before implementation
4. WHEN building debug mode THEN tests SHALL verify debug output format before writing debug functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the interpreter from the command line, so that I can easily execute BASIC programs in my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the interpreter with a filename argument THEN it SHALL load and execute that BASIC program
2. WHEN I run the interpreter without arguments THEN it SHALL start in interactive mode
3. WHEN in interactive mode THEN I SHALL be able to enter BASIC commands line by line
4. WHEN I use command line flags THEN the interpreter SHALL support options like debug mode or help information

#### TDD Requirements

1. WHEN implementing CLI argument parsing THEN tests SHALL verify all flag combinations before writing parsing logic
2. WHEN adding interactive mode THEN tests SHALL use mocked input/output to verify REPL behavior before implementation
3. WHEN creating file execution mode THEN tests SHALL verify file loading and execution flow before coding
4. WHEN handling CLI errors THEN tests SHALL define expected help messages and error responses before implementation
