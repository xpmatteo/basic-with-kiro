# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a BASIC interpreter written in Go that can parse, execute, and manage BASIC programs. The interpreter will support core BASIC language constructs including variables, control flow, arithmetic operations, and basic I/O operations. This will provide users with a functional programming environment for running classic BASIC programs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to load and execute BASIC programs from files, so that I can run existing BASIC code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid BASIC program file THEN the interpreter SHALL load and parse the program successfully
2. WHEN a user executes a loaded program THEN the interpreter SHALL execute each line in the correct sequence
3. IF a program file contains syntax errors THEN the interpreter SHALL report clear error messages with line numbers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use variables and perform arithmetic operations, so that I can write programs that manipulate data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program assigns a value to a variable THEN the interpreter SHALL store the value and make it available for subsequent operations
2. WHEN a program performs arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^) THEN the interpreter SHALL calculate the correct result
3. WHEN a program uses both numeric and string variables THEN the interpreter SHALL handle type distinctions appropriately
4. IF a variable is used before being assigned THEN the interpreter SHALL initialize numeric variables to 0 and string variables to empty string

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use control flow statements (GOTO, IF-THEN, FOR-NEXT), so that I can create programs with loops and conditional logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program executes a GOTO statement THEN the interpreter SHALL jump to the specified line number
2. WHEN a program executes an IF-THEN statement THEN the interpreter SHALL evaluate the condition and execute the THEN clause only if true
3. WHEN a program executes a FOR-NEXT loop THEN the interpreter SHALL iterate the specified number of times with correct variable incrementation
4. IF a GOTO references a non-existent line number THEN the interpreter SHALL report an error
5. IF a FOR loop is missing its corresponding NEXT THEN the interpreter SHALL report an error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform input and output operations (PRINT, INPUT), so that my programs can interact with users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program executes a PRINT statement THEN the interpreter SHALL output the specified values to stdout
2. WHEN a program executes an INPUT statement THEN the interpreter SHALL prompt the user and read their input into the specified variable
3. WHEN printing multiple values THEN the interpreter SHALL separate them appropriately (spaces or specified separators)
4. WHEN reading input for numeric variables THEN the interpreter SHALL validate and convert the input appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use built-in functions (ABS, INT, RND, etc.), so that I can perform common mathematical operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program calls ABS(x) THEN the interpreter SHALL return the absolute value of x
2. WHEN a program calls INT(x) THEN the interpreter SHALL return the integer part of x
3. WHEN a program calls RND THEN the interpreter SHALL return a random number between 0 and 1
4. WHEN a program calls LEN(string) THEN the interpreter SHALL return the length of the string
5. IF a function is called with invalid arguments THEN the interpreter SHALL report an appropriate error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling and debugging information, so that I can identify and fix issues in my BASIC programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a runtime error occurs THEN the interpreter SHALL display the error message with the line number where it occurred
2. WHEN a syntax error is detected THEN the interpreter SHALL report the error before execution begins
3. WHEN the interpreter encounters an infinite loop THEN it SHALL provide a way to interrupt execution
4. WHEN debugging mode is enabled THEN the interpreter SHALL show each line before execution

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the interpreter from the command line, so that I can easily execute BASIC programs in my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the interpreter with a filename argument THEN it SHALL load and execute that BASIC program
2. WHEN I run the interpreter without arguments THEN it SHALL start in interactive mode
3. WHEN in interactive mode THEN I SHALL be able to enter BASIC commands line by line
4. WHEN I use command line flags THEN the interpreter SHALL support options like debug mode or help information
